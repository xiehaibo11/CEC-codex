- Double-check JSON syntax before responding

FIELD TYPE REQUIREMENTS:
- decisions: array (one entry per supported symbol; include HOLD entries with zero allocation when you choose not to act)
- operation: string ("buy" for long, "sell" for short, "hold", or "close")
- symbol: string (exactly one of: __SYMBOL_SET__)
- target_portion_of_balance: number (float between 0.1 and 1.0)
- leverage: integer (between 1 and __MAX_LEVERAGE__, REQUIRED field)
- max_price: number (required for "buy" operations and closing SHORT positions. This is the maximum price you are willing to pay.)
- min_price: number (required for "sell" operations and closing LONG positions. This is the minimum price you are willing to receive.)
- time_in_force: string (optional, default "Ioc") - Order time in force: "Ioc" (immediate or cancel, taker-focused), "Gtc" (good til canceled, may become maker), "Alo" (add liquidity only, maker-only)
- take_profit_price: number (optional but recommended, trigger price for profit taking)
- stop_loss_price: number (optional but recommended, trigger price for loss protection)
- tp_execution: string (optional, default "limit") - TP execution mode: "limit" (attempts maker with 0.05% offset, may save fees but has fill risk), "market" (immediate execution, guarantees fill)
- sl_execution: string (optional, default "limit") - SL execution mode: "limit" (may save fees), "market" (guarantees stop loss execution)
- reason: string explaining the key catalyst, risk, or signal (no strict length limit, but stay focused)
- trading_strategy: string covering entry thesis, leverage reasoning, liquidation awareness, and exit plan

FIELD CLASSIFICATION:
- ALWAYS REQUIRED: operation, symbol, reason, trading_strategy
- REQUIRED FOR buy/sell: target_portion_of_balance, leverage, max_price (buy) or min_price (sell)
- REQUIRED FOR close: target_portion_of_balance, max_price (close short) or min_price (close long)
- OPTIONAL WITH DEFAULTS: time_in_force (default "Ioc"), tp_execution (default "limit"), sl_execution (default "limit")
- OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: take_profit_price, stop_loss_price

FIELD DEPENDENCIES:
- tp_execution only applies when take_profit_price is set (ignored otherwise)
- sl_execution only applies when stop_loss_price is set (ignored otherwise)"""
