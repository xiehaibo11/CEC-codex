# System Health Check

Perform a comprehensive health assessment of the user's CEC-codex
setup. Evaluate all components and provide an overall health score with
actionable recommendations.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Foundation Check (Environment & Watchlist)

Before checking components, verify the system foundation:

1. **Trading Environment**: Use `get_trading_environment()`
   - Confirm current mode (testnet/mainnet)
   - Remind user this affects all operations

2. **Watchlist Configuration**: Use `get_watchlist()`
   - Check if user is still using default watchlist (only BTC)
   - If yes, flag as **Warning**: "Using default watchlist — only BTC data is being collected"
   - List symbols currently being monitored for each exchange
   - Check if any signal pools reference symbols NOT in the watchlist

→ [CHECKPOINT] Report environment and watchlist status. Flag warnings if using defaults.

### Phase 1: System Overview

Gather baseline data using `get_system_overview`:
- Total AI Traders count and their enabled/disabled status
- LLM configuration status (provider, model)
- Wallet binding status and balances
- Strategy binding overview (Prompt and Program counts)
- Signal pool status and active count

Present a quick summary table of component status.

→ [CHECKPOINT] Show system overview. Ask if user wants detailed checks.

### Phase 2: Runtime Status Check

Check active components:

- Use `list_traders` to inspect each trader:
  - Is trading enabled?
  - When was the last trigger (`last_trigger_at`)?
  - Are there any stuck traders (enabled but no recent triggers)?
- Check Program Bindings activation status
- Check signal pool recent trigger history
- Verify wallet balances are sufficient for trading

Flag any anomalies:
- Traders enabled but not triggering for >24 hours
- Signal pools with no recent signals
- Wallets with zero or very low balance
- Program bindings that are inactive

→ [CHECKPOINT] Present runtime status with health indicators.

### Phase 3: Error Log Analysis (Exchange-Aware)

Use `get_system_logs` to check for recent errors. The response now includes:
- **`severity_summary`**: counts of CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO/NOISE errors
- **`user_exchange`**: detected exchange (hyperliquid/binance/null)
- **`registry`** on each log: severity, exchange tag, affected subsystem, suggestion

**Filtering rules**:
1. **Ignore NOISE errors entirely** — they are transient/harmless
2. **Deprioritize `other_exchange` errors** — if a log's `registry.relevance` is `other_exchange`, it means the error is from an exchange the user doesn't use. Mention it only in passing (e.g., "also saw 3 Hyperliquid errors but you use Binance — not relevant to you")
3. **Focus on CRITICAL errors for user's active exchange** — these block trading
4. **Report WARNING errors** for user's exchange as secondary concerns
5. **Use registry suggestions** to provide actionable guidance

**Severity categories**:
- **CRITICAL**: Prevents trading (API down, insufficient balance, invalid keys)
- **WARNING**: Degraded functionality (stale data, parse errors, WS disconnects)
- **INFO**: Normal operations (price snapshots, HOLD decisions, notifications)
- **NOISE**: Scheduler overlaps, deprecation warnings, connection resets

→ [CHECKPOINT] Present overall health assessment:
  - Health score (Healthy / Needs Attention / Critical)
  - Summary of issues found, **filtered by user's exchange**
  - Prioritized list of recommended actions with registry suggestions
  - Offer to help fix any issues found

## Key Rules

- Always use tool calls for real data — never fabricate status
- Present results in a clear, non-technical format
- Prioritize actionable recommendations
- If everything is healthy, confirm it clearly
- For critical issues, offer to run trader-diagnosis skill
