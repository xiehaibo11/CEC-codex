Add exchange field to AIDecisionLog and ProgramExecutionLog tables.

This migration adds an 'exchange' column to track which exchange the decision
was executed on (hyperliquid or binance).

Backward compatibility:
- NULL values are treated as "hyperliquid" for historical data
- New records should explicitly set the exchange field
